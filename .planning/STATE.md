# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Every database change is captured and delivered reliably, in order, with zero infrastructure dependencies beyond the database itself.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of ? in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-07 -- Completed 01-02 (CLI skeleton, cobra flags, Makefile, pure-Go build verification)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 4%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4 min, 3 min
- Trend: establishing baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Split research's 6-phase structure into 10 phases for comprehensive depth -- separates Event Log from Backfill, Router from Output Servers, Config from HA
- [Roadmap]: MongoDB connector placed after HA (Phase 9) so it benefits from all production hardening
- [Roadmap]: Rust FFI last (Phase 10) -- performance optimization only after correctness is proven
- [01-01]: json.RawMessage without omitempty for Before/After fields -- nil serializes as JSON null, gives consumers a consistent 10-field schema regardless of operation type
- [01-01]: io.Writer injection in logging.Setup() -- enables test capture via bytes.Buffer without mocking global slog
- [01-01]: Module path github.com/kaptanto/kaptanto -- can be changed with find-and-replace before first public release
- [Phase 01-02]: NewRootCmd() factory function for test isolation — fresh cobra.Command per test, no global state contamination
- [Phase 01-02]: RunE no-op placeholder on root command — required for cobra to render flags section in help output
- [Phase 01-02]: Retention default 0s at CLI layer — actual 1h default applied at runtime when Event Log initializes
